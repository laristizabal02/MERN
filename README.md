# MERN PROJECT

## Description
This project was originally built using fetch requests for data handling. My responsibility was to refactor the project to use the MERN stack with GraphQL, Apollo, and mutations. Both the client and server parts of the application were updated to incorporate these technologies.

## Technologies Used
- MongoDB
- Express.js
- React.js
- Node.js
- GraphQL
- Apollo Client/Server

## Features
- Refactored data fetching to use GraphQL queries and mutations
- Integrated Apollo Client on the frontend for state management
- Set up Apollo Server on the backend to handle GraphQL requests
- Updated MongoDB models and Express routes to work with GraphQL
